This is going to be a plugin for doing lightbox effects. Another one, I know.

But! The goal is to integrate Video for Everyone (http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody) for media playback, as well as image lightboxes. 

Images: Limited to the available viewport, could be an easy to modify flag (FALSE will allow full img source size)

Videos: Video for Everyone

Audio: Not planned? Should we imbed audio somehow? I don't think audio needs to be that focused on the page. Thoughts Dylan?

Slideshow: Instead of rel= use HTML5 data attribute. Normal lightboxing[$tag] used for relations for galleries.

More notes to come, here's a starting point
